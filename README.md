# gerkins

gerkins is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

### Running gerkins Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start gerkins locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    gerkins>

Then you can interact with gerkins by typing `gerkins help`.

    gerkins> gerkins help
    gerkins animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    gerkins help - Displays all of the help commands that gerkins knows about.
    ...

### Jenkingd
gerkins needs to run with Jenkingd. You can set up Jenkingd by going to [Jenkingd][jenkingd].
